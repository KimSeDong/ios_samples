# Google Maps SDK for iOS samples #

Some samples I build while testing  Google Maps SDK for iOS 


## Using samples ##


1. Getting an API key 
  
	Go to [Google APIs Console](https://code.google.com/apis/console/) get a key and register the AppID(bundle identifier). 
  More on this [in the docs](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start)


2. Get GoogleMaps SDK

    1. Get the [SDK](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start) and 
    2. Drag the GoogleMaps.framework bundle to the Frameworks group of your project. When prompted, select Copy items into destination group's folder.
    3. Right-click GoogleMaps.framework in your project, and select Show In Finder.
    4. Drag the GoogleMaps.bundle from the Resources folder to your project. We suggest putting it in the Frameworks group. When prompted, ensure Copy items into destination group's folder is not selected.

3. If something goes wrong
You should be go, because the rest of the setup is in the configuration alrady, but in case you have any problems 
follow the instructions from [the setup guide](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/ios/start#adding_the_google_maps_sdk_for_ios_to_your_project)
